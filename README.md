What you need to know about Microsoft Office tests for employees online

Owing to the various shortcomings of traditional recruitment processes, more and more businesses are choosing to put job candidates through psychometric testing. Along with providing invaluable insights into individual character traits and behavioural tendencies, these assessments can also look at essential skills like numeracy and language.

What’s more, they can also reveal whether would-be employees have the experience and expertise required to use certain Microsoft Office applications correctly. After all, most people only use around 20 per cent or less of their full capability, which could have a detrimental knock-on effect to your organisation’s productivity levels and profit margins. 

Therefore, it makes total sense to utilise this kind of assessment at the pre-employment stage. If you would still like more information, here is everything you need to know about Microsoft Office tests for employees online. 

What is a Microsoft Word Test?

As HR and recruitment specialist Skillsarena explains: “The Microsoft Word assessment is fully simulated and available at a variety of levels enabling you to assess at a level relevant to both the candidate and the role. A comprehensive report breaks down ability by level, percentile and correct answers.”

With the assessments available from Skillsarena, candidates can be tested at basic, intermediate, and expert levels, which were initially based on Microsoft Training but have since changed according to real-world, day-to-day activities. 

When it comes to choosing a level, you should think carefully about how the application will be typically used. For example, basic will cover tasks performed regularly and easily, while expert requires an in-depth understanding of functions used less frequently.

Microsoft Office applications available for testing

Microsoft Word

The most popular word processing application in the world is extremely simple and straightforward to use. However, it also has a number of tools and capabilities that can allow for greater productivity. 

Sample questions:

•	Basic - Change the text to bold
•	Intermediate - Change the save options so that a backup copy of the document is always created
•	Expert - Reveal all formatting in the current document.

Microsoft Excel

The go-to application for creating spreadsheets and charts, Microsoft Excel has seemingly limitless possibilities when it comes to processing numerical information. Candidates that can understand its intricacies and perform complex formulas will gain an immediate advantage over others. 

Sample questions:

•	Basic - Clear the data in cell B4.
•	Intermediate - Give the chart on the worksheet “Charts” the title “Staff”.
•	Expert - In the current worksheet use the filter list option so that only “Electronics” items are displayed.

Microsoft PowerPoint

Now synonymous with slideshow presentations, Microsoft PowerPoint continues to be an essential office application. Along with finding out the competencies of candidates, testing can also unearth their creativity levels.

Sample questions:

•	Basic - View the presentation without using F5
•	Intermediate - Automatically change the title of the current slide to “Title Case”
•	Expert - Use PowerPoint to send the presentation as an email attachment

Microsoft Outlook

Seeing as email is crucial for office-based communication, it is little wonder why businesses want to assess individual ability on Microsoft Outlook. This email client is easy to get to grips with but often requires more in-depth knowledge.

Sample questions:

•	Basic - Create a new appointment
•	Intermediate - Navigate to where you would find all overdue tasks
•	Expert - Change the configuration of Outlook to spellcheck all messages before they are sent
